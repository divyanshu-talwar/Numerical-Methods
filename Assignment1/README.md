## Installation and Execution
* Type `cd answer1` on the console to move into the respective directory (replace answer1 with answer2 or answer3 to go into others). 
* After moving into the directory type `make` command on the console and the object file of the `C program` will be generated.
* Then type `./fixed_point_iteration` if in `answer1` or `./newtons+secant` if in `answer2` or `./find_kth_root` if in `answer3` on the console and the program runs.
* Give the input as per the prompts and required output will be generated on STD out.
