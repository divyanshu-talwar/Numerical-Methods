# Numerical Methods Endsem Project
## About
* This project aimed to develop a theoritical understanding of the `Crank Nicolson method` to solve the 1-D heat equation. The same was achieved by solving the problems, which included, finding the `order` and performing the `von Neumann stability analysis` for the same.
* Also, to strengthen this theoritical understanding, we were to write a python script to perform the same, given sample test cases.
* The folder contains the python scripts to the same.

## Installation and Execution
* Run `python <python_script_name>` and the program will run for the given set of inputs.
* Required output will be generated on STD out and graphs will be displayed separately.
